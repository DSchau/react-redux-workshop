# React Redux Workshop Labs and Slides

## Setup

Prior to attending the workshop, we ask to validate your machine setup so that we can ensure a smooth workshop focused on learning React, not tweaking machine setup!

1. Please ensure you have all the requested tooling (e.g. git) as specified in [setup instructions](./labs/lab-01-setup.md)
1. Run `node verify.js`

If all goes well, you should see

> ðŸŽ‰  Congrats! Your system is setup properly
> 
> You should be good to install and run things.
