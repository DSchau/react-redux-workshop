# React Redux Workshop Labs and Slides
___

## Setup

Prior to attending the workshop, we ask to validate your machine setup so that we can ensure a smooth workshop focused on learning React, not tweaking machine setup!

1. Please ensure you have all the requested tooling (e.g. git) as specified in [setup instructions](./labs/lab-01-setup.md)
1. `git clone https://github.com/objectpartners/react-redux-workshop.git`
1. `cd react-redux-workshop`
1. `node verify.js`

If all goes well, you should see

> ðŸŽ‰  Congrats! Your system is setup properly
> 
> You should be good to install and run things.

## Forking

Alternately, you may consider forking the `react-redux-workshop` to your own personal account. You can do that like so:

1. Fork from the GitHub web UI (top right "Fork" button)
1. Use the new git repo URL that was created. For instance, `https://github.com/myaccountname/react-redux-workshop.git`
1. Follow the other steps as normal
